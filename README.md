## Cluster Reducer Utility
- This Python script takes a list of tuples representing circles on a coordinate plane, groups them into clusters based on overlap, and then reduces each cluster to the circle with the largest area

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 +

## Files
- `cluster_utils.py` contains `Circle` and `Cluster` classes, and `reduce_clusters` function.
- `main.py` contains the `main` function that uses `reduce_clusters` to process the input data and print the result

## Usage
- Clone or download the repository
- Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` in the terminal
- Run `python main.py`

## Testing
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run `python -m unittest test_cluster_utils.py` to test the function
